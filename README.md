### What is JuiceBot?

JuiceBot is a simple open-source bot that is really easy to fork. I hope.

### How do I use it?

JuiceBot's "hub" is located **[here](https://cevacinevus.gitbook.io/juicebot/)**. Here you can check good resources you can use for your own bots, other developer resources, or if you are not a developer, you can just check out the website for a list of commands.

Since JuiceBot is built upon Node.js, all the resources on the website will be related to npm, discord.js, and node.js.

If you don't have Node.js, download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You can read more about this process on JuiceBot's hub.
