### What is JuiceBot?

JuiceBot is a simple open-source bot that is really easy to fork. I hope. [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/lambdagit101/juicebot/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/lambdagit101/juicebot) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-who%20cares-green)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

### How do I use it?

JuiceBot's "hub" is located **[here](https://cevacinevus.gitbook.io/juicebot/)**. Here you can check good resources you can use for your own bots, other developer resources, or if you are not a developer, you can just check out the website for a list of commands.

Since JuiceBot is built upon Node.js, all the resources on the website will be related to npm, discord.js, and node.js.

If you don't have Node.js, download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You can read more about this process on JuiceBot's hub.

### How do I change the tokens?

You can make a file called `.env.` and add the required variables. The required variables are:
`BOT_TOKEN` is your bot's token.

`KSOFTSI_TOKEN` adds things like some image commands and some other things I do not know how to explain.

`AFAPI_KEY` is for the alexflipnote.dev API.

`MONGODB_URL` is used for the leveling system.

`LEVEL_SYSTEM` determines whether the leveling system is enabled or not. It should either be `true` or absolutely anything. 

### What is the bot's prefix?
